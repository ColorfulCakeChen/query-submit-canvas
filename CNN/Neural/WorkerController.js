/**
 * The container of WorkerProxy. It orchestrates these WorkerProxy. Especially, it transfers (scaled) source image data to and from
 * web worker. This could maximize parallel computing under the restriction transferring source image data to every web worker serially.
 *
 * Every worker handles one neural network. When processTensor() is called, the input (usually a large memory block)
 * will be transffered to the 1st worker to start computing, and then transffered to the 2nd worker to start computing, ... etc.
 *
 * When passing large data by Worker.postMessage(), it is preferred by transferring (not by copying). If the large data wants to be
 * transferred (not copied) to many workers, the only possible way is to transferring them serially.
 *
 * However, serially transferring hurts the performance. Workers are better to compute parallelly. So every worker should transfer the
 * (possible scaled) source image data back to this WorkerController, and keep computing neural network at the same. And then, this
 * WorkerController will transfer the source image data to the next worker as soon as possible.
 *
 * Finally, this WorkerController collects all web workers' processTensor() results in a promise. The promise will resolve with an array
 * of typed-array. Every typed-array is the output of one neural network.
