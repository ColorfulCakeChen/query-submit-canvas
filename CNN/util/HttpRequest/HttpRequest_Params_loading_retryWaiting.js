/**
 * The parameters for HttpRequest.Fetcher's loading timeout and retry waiting time.
 *
 *
 * @member {number} loadingMillisecondsMax
 *   The maximum time (in milliseconds) a request can take before automatically
 * being terminated. Default is 0, which means there is no timeout.
 *
 *   - If zero, the progressLoading will be advanced by ProgressEvent(
 *       .type = "progress" ).
 *     - This is good if ( .lengthComputable == true ) and network smooth.
 *     - This is bad if ( .lengthComputable == false ) (i.e. progress can not
 *         be calculated by .loaded / .total) or network congested (i.e.
 *         there will be a long pending (no responded in UI)).
 *
 *   - If not zero, the progressLoading will be advanced by a timer.
 *       Although this is a kind of fake progress, it provides better user
 *       experience because progress bar is still advancing even if network
 *       congested or server busy.
 *
 * @member {number} loadingMillisecondsInterval
 *   The interval time (in milliseconds) for advancing the loadingMillisecondsCur.
 * Although smaller interval may provide smoother progress advancing, however, too
 * small interval (relative to loadingMillisecondsMax) may not look good because
 * the progress bar may advance too little to be aware by eyes.
 *
 * @member {number} retryTimesMax
 *   Retry request so many times at most when request failed (ProgressEvent
 * is error, or load without status 200, or timeout). Note1: Never retry if
 * ( ProgressEvent is abort ) or ( unknown error ). Note2: There will be some
 * waiting time before next re-try (i.e. truncated (binary) exponential backoff
 * algorithm).
 *
 *   - Negative value means retry infinite times (i.e. retry forever until
 *       success).
 *
 *   - Zero means never retry (i.e. failed immediately once not success).
 *
 *   - Positive value means retry so many times at most.
 *
 * @member {number} retryWaitingSecondsExponentMax
 *   The maximum exponent (for two's power; i.e. the B of ( 2 ** B ) ) of retry
 * waiting time (in seconds, not in milliseconds). It is only used if
 * ( retryTimesMax > 0 ). For example,
 *   - 0 means ( 2 ** 0 ) = 1 second.
 *   - 1 means ( 2 ** 1 ) = 2 seconds
 *   - 2 means ( 2 ** 2 ) = 4 seconds
 *   - ...
 *   - 6 means ( 2 ** 6 ) = 64 seconds.
 *
 * @member {number} retryWaitingMillisecondsInterval
 *   The interval time (in milliseconds) for advancing retryWaitingMillisecondsCur.
 * Although smaller interval may provide smoother progress advancing, however,
 * too small interval (relative to retryWaitingMillisecondsMax) may not look good
 * because the progress bar may advance too little to be aware by eyes.
