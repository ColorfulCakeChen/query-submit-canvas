/**
 * @file This is a scheme for encoding a floating-point number by 2 Base64 (i.e.
 * Uint6 [ 0, 63 ]) characters.
 *
 * Because 12 bits (= 2 * 6 bits ) are used to representing a floating-point
 * number, so called float12.
 *
 *   - sign: 1 bit.
 *   - exponent: 6 bits.
 *   - fraction: 5 bits.
 *
 *
 *    bit                    bit
 *     11                     0
 *      s e e e e e e f f f f f 
 *
 *
 * It is a shorter floating-point representation (especially similar to bfloat16).
 * However, float12 is mainly used for storage (i.e. not for computation). So, it
 * has no NaN value, no sub-normal value. And it views the representable value
 * which is closest to zero (i.e. exponent_unsigned = 0 and fraction_unsigned = 0)
 * as 0 (this is different from standard floating-point representation).
