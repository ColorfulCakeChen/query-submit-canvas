 * An object operates several TensorPlaceholder.Base.

 * In operation (e.g. Pointwise.Base), it is used for tracking the tensor placeholders of the operation. It is used to get input tensor(s)
 * and output tensor(s) in Operation.apply().
 *

 * @member {TensorPlaceholder.Base} input0
 *   The TensorPlaceholder object which represents this operation's first input. It (from constructor) will be kept (not cloned)
 * directly. So caller should not modify them.
 *
 * @member {TensorPlaceholder.Base} input1
 *   The TensorPlaceholder object which represents this operation's second input. It could be null which means this operation
 * does not have second input tensor. It (from constructor) will be kept (not cloned) directly. So caller should not modify them.
 *
 * @param {number} inputTensorCount
 *   How many input tensor placeholders.
 * 
 * @member {TensorPlaceholder.Base} output0
 *   The TensorPlaceholder object which represents this operation's first output. It will be created by constructor if
 * outputTensorCount (of constructor) is >= 1.
 *
 * @member {TensorPlaceholder.Base} output1
 *   The TensorOpCounter object which represents this operation's second output. It is only created by constructor if
 * outputTensorCount (of constructor) is >= 2.
 *
 * @param {number} outputTensorCount
 *   How many output tensor placeholders. It's value is between [ 0, 2 ].
