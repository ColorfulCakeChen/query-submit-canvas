 * as outputTensor. Both inputTensors are tf.tensor3d and represents an images ( height x width x channel ) which will be added. They
 * should have the same channel count. Their ( height x width ) should be either the same or one is ( 1 x 1 ). The outputTensor
 * (tf.tensor3d) represents the result of adding the two inputs. The inputTensors may or may not be disposed. In fact, this method
 * calls one of Add_and_keep0_keep1(), Add_and_keep0_destroy1(), Add_and_destroy0_keep1(), Add_and_destroy0_destroy1() according to
