/**
 * Calculate the channel count of lower half (of input and output) and higher half (of input and output) when the higher half of
 * input should be past-through to output.
 *
 * It is mainly used for pointwise1/pointwise2 of ShuffleNetV2_ByMopbileNetV1's body/tail.
 *
 * @member {number} inputChannelCount_total
 *   The total input channel count.
 *
 * @member {number} outputChannelCount_total
 *   The total output channel count.
 *
 * @member {number} outputChannelCount_total_real
 *   It is usually the same as outputChannelCount_total. However, if ( outputChannelCount_total <= 0 ), it will be the same as
 * inputChannelCount_total instead. That is, it will be the same as input when no output is specified.
 *
 * @member {number} inputChannelCount_lowerHalf
 *   The lower half of the input channel count. (= Math.ceil( inputChannelCount_total / 2 ) )
 *
 * @member {number} inputChannelCount_higherHalf
 *   The higher half of the input channel count. (= ( inputChannelCount_total - inputChannelCount_lowerHalf ) )
 *
 * @member {number} outputChannelCount_lowerHalf
 *   The lower half of the output channel count. (= ( outputChannelCount_total_real - inputChannelCount_higherHalf ) )
 *
 * @member {number} outputChannelCount_higherHalf
 *   The higher half of the output channel count. (= inputChannelCount_higherHalf )
